## Why This Document Exists

Joining anything new feels uncertain. You might wonder:

- Am I doing this right?
- Will I look foolish?
- What if I mess something up?

This guide answers those questions directly. Everything described here is **normal**. Not just tolerated—genuinely normal and expected.

---

## Part 1: First Events

### Arriving Alone

**This is normal.** Most people arrive alone. It's the most common way to attend.

- You do not need a buddy to sign up or show up
- Event hosts expect solo arrivals and will help you feel included
- Looking around a room and recognizing no one is normal for your first several events

### The Feeling of Not Knowing Anyone

**This is normal.** Other people are also scanning the room hoping someone will talk to them.

What to do:

- Look for someone else standing alone near the refreshments—they'd probably love it if you said hello
- Find anyone with a name tag and introduce yourself
- Your mentor can meet you there if you'd like a familiar face

### Standing Around Awkwardly

**This is normal.** Everyone does this at some point, especially in the first few minutes.

It does not mean you are failing. It means you just arrived.

### Leaving Early

**You can leave any event whenever you want.**

- You do not need to announce your departure or explain why
- A quiet wave to the host on your way out is appreciated but not required
- Leaving early does not mean you failed at the event
- Your energy is yours to manage

## Part 2: Registration and Cancellation

### Canceling a Registration

**You can cancel. Plans change.**

- Cancel if you need to—no explanation required
- Your spot automatically goes to the next person on the waitlist
- There is no penalty
- There is no "permanent record" of cancellations

### Being on a Waitlist

**This is normal.** Being waitlisted does not mean you did something wrong.

- Popular events often have waitlists of 5-15 people
- Many waitlisted people do get in

### Missing an Event You Registered For

**Life happens.** If you forget or can't make it:

- The world continues
- Your spot goes to the waitlist automatically
- A pattern of no-shows might get a gentle check-in—but this is care, not punishment

## Part 3: Name Tags and Signals

SBNC uses visual signals to help members connect:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Red badge or ribbon** | New member (first year)—others will reach out to welcome you |
| **"Mentor" tag** | Specifically there to help newcomers |
| **"Ask Me" or star** | Experienced member happy to answer questions |
| **Officer title** | Club leadership, but still approachable |

### About the Red Badge

- It is not a scarlet letter. It is an invitation for others to introduce themselves.
- You will not wear it forever. After your first year, you get a regular badge.
- Mentors look for red badges specifically so they can say hello.

### If You Forget Your Badge

**You can still attend.** The host will have a temporary name tag.

---

## Part 4: About Mentors

When you join, you may be paired with a **mentor**—a member who volunteered to help newcomers feel comfortable.

### What Mentors Do

- Reach out to say hello
- Offer to meet you at an event
- Answer questions about how things work
- Introduce you to a few people

### What Mentors Do NOT Do

- Track whether you attend events
- Report on your participation to anyone
- Expect you to stay in constant touch
- Judge you for anything

Think of your mentor as a **friendly neighbor**, not a supervisor.

## Part 5: Making Mistakes

### The Truth About Mistakes

| What You Fear | What Actually Happens |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Sign up for wrong event | Cancel and sign up for the right one |
| Show up on wrong day | Laugh about it, go home, come back next time |
| Forget someone's name | Ask again—everyone forgets names |
| Spill something | Someone hands you a napkin |
| Say something awkward | The conversation moves on within seconds |
| Miss an event you registered for | Nothing. Your spot goes to the waitlist. |

### Real Mistakes We've Seen (All Turned Out Fine)

- Someone showed up to a hike in sandals. They still hiked.
- Someone brought wine to a morning coffee event. People laughed kindly. Someone drank the wine.
- Someone called the club president by the wrong name for three months. The president thought it was funny.

## Part 6: You Will Not Break Anything

This section is specifically for people who worry about clicking the wrong button.

### What You Can Always Undo

| Action | Can You Undo It? |
|--------|------------------|
| Registration | Yes—cancel anytime before the event |
| Waitlist | Yes—remove yourself whenever you want |
| Profile updates | Yes—change your info anytime |
| Email preferences | Yes—adjust without affecting membership |

### What the System Prevents

- **No accidental payments** — Payment screens require explicit confirmation
- **No public mistakes** — Your registration history is not visible to other members
- **No permanent records of awkwardness** — There is no database of social missteps

### What Only Administrators Can Do

Regular members cannot accidentally:

- Delete events
- Remove other members
- Send mass emails
- Change club policies
- Break the website

**You literally cannot break these things.**

## Part 7: What Is and Isn't Tracked

### What IS Logged (for operational reasons)

| Data | Why | Who Sees It |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Event registrations | So we know who's coming | Event hosts, administrators |
| Attendance (attended/no-show) | To manage waitlists fairly | Administrators only |
| Membership status | To verify you're a member | Administrators only |
| Payment transactions | Legal/financial requirements | Treasurer, administrators |

### What Is NOT Tracked

| Not Tracked | Why Not |
|-------------|---------|
| How long you stayed at an event | Your time is yours |
| Who you talked to | None of our business |
| How many times you've attended | We're not scoring you |
| What you said at events | We're not monitoring conversations |
| Whether you made friends | Not measurable, not our concern |
| Your "engagement level" | We don't have engagement scores |

**Philosophy**: We track what we need to run the club. We don't track your social performance.

---

## Part 8: For Mentors and Officers

If you're helping welcome new members, here's what they need to hear:

1. **You are not being evaluated.** There is no score.
2. **Questions are welcome.** Ask anything, any time.
3. **It gets easier.** The third event is much more comfortable than the first.
4. **You belong here.** Membership is not conditional on performance.

### Things to Avoid Saying

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Check the website" | Answer the question directly |
| "You'll need to register first" | "Just sign up and you're in" |
| "Make sure you qualify" | "This is open to all members" |

**Why This Matters**: New members are listening for signals about whether they belong. Conditional language implies uncertainty about their welcome.

At SBNC, **membership is the qualification**. Don't make people prove they deserve to participate.

## Summary: The Short Version

| Leave early | **Allowed** |
| Cancel registration | **Fine** |
| Forget names | **Human** |
