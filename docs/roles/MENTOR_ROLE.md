- **[CHATBOT_BEHAVIORAL_GUIDE.md](../chatbot/CHATBOT_BEHAVIORAL_GUIDE.md)** — How chatbot surfaces mentor connections

## Purpose

A Mentor helps new members feel welcome, reduces the anxiety of being new, and demonstrates that volunteering is approachable.

**In one sentence:** Mentors turn "I just joined" into "I know someone."

### Why This Role Exists

From the SBNC Business Model:

> Fear is the primary barrier at every stage... The flywheel is fragile at the "new member to confident participant" transition. This is why the Mentor role exists.

Mentors directly address the most common new-member fears:

| Fear | How Mentor Helps |
|------|------------------|
| "Will I know anyone?" | Yes—you'll know your mentor |
| "What if I don't fit in?" | Mentor introduces you to people with shared interests |
| "What if I do something wrong?" | Mentor normalizes uncertainty; there's no wrong way |
| "I don't want to impose" | Mentor's job is literally to welcome you |

---

## Scope

### What Mentors Do

| Activity | Timing | Required? |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Send welcome message to assigned newbie | Within 7 days of assignment | Yes |
| Answer questions about club norms and logistics | As needed | Yes |
| Attend 1-2 events together | First 60 days | Encouraged |
| Monthly check-in (brief) | Days 30, 60, 90 | Yes |
| Connect newbie to members with shared interests | Ongoing | Encouraged |

### What Mentors Do NOT Do

| Not in Scope | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Recruit new members | VP Membership responsibility |
| Collect dues or process payments | Treasurer responsibility |
| Make policy decisions | **Not a governance actor** |
| Chair events | Separate, larger commitment |
| Resolve complaints or conflicts | Escalate to VP Activities or President |
| Guarantee newbie outcomes | Success = newbie knows someone, not "joins everything" |
| Track or report on newbie behavior | Not a supervisor |

---

## Authority

### Explicitly NOT a Governance Actor

**Mentors have zero governance authority.** They cannot:

- Vote on club matters (unless held via another role)
- Access admin dashboards
- View other members' data
- Modify any records
- Approve or deny anything

### Access Granted

| Data | Access |
|------|--------|
| Assigned newbie's name | Yes |
| Assigned newbie's email | Yes |
| Assigned newbie's event registrations | Yes (to coordinate attendance) |
| Other members' data | **No** |
| Financial information | **No** |
| Admin dashboards | **No** |

This limited authority is intentional. **Mentors are guides, not administrators.**

---

## Signals and Visibility

### Name Tag Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **"MENTOR" ribbon or badge** | This person is available to help newcomers |
| **Red badge/ribbon on newbie** | This person is new; mentors should say hello |

### Dashboard Markers (ClubOS)

| Marker | Where | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| "Your Mentor: [Name]" | Newbie's dashboard | Clear visibility of assigned mentor |
| "Mentor" badge | Member profile | Identifies mentors in directory |
| "Mentees: [List]" | Mentor's dashboard | Shows active assignments |
| Co-attendance indicator | Event details | Shows when mentor and mentee are both registered |

### Chatbot Integration

The chatbot proactively surfaces mentor connections:

- "Have you connected with your mentor yet?"
- "Would you like me to check if your mentor is attending?"
- "Your mentor knows lots of people and can introduce you."

---

## Time Commitment

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Initial orientation | 30 minutes (one-time) |
| Welcome outreach per newbie | 15 minutes |
| Monthly check-ins (3 total) | 30 minutes total |
| Optional event attendance | Mentor's choice |

**Total: 1-2 hours over 90 days per newbie.**

Typical assignment: **1-2 newbies at a time** (max 3 to prevent burnout).

## Relationship to Third-Year Membership

### Gateway, Not Qualifier

From the SBNC Business Model:

> Third-year members are the ideal volunteer recruitment pool because they know how the club works, have established relationships, and are looking for "what's next."

Mentoring is designed as **the answer to "what's next"** for engaged members.

### What This Means

| Statement | True or False |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Third-year members should consider mentoring" | **True** — they're ideal candidates |
| "Mentoring is required to remain a member at year 3" | **False** — membership is not conditional |
| "Mentoring counts as volunteer contribution" | **True** — it's the first volunteer step |
| "Mentoring is required before other volunteer roles" | **False** — gateway, not prerequisite |
| "Only third-year members can mentor" | **False** — year 2+ members can mentor |

### Third-Year Recruitment Strategy

When a member reaches their third year:

1. System flags them as potential mentor candidate
2. VP Membership (or chatbot) surfaces the opportunity
3. Framing: "You know how it felt to be new. Now you can be that friendly face for someone else."
4. No pressure, no penalty for declining

This is an **invitation**, not a mandate.

---

## Position in the Volunteer Flywheel

```
New Member (Year 1)
    ↓
Engaged Member (Year 2)
    ↓
Invited to Mentor (Year 2-3)  ← THIS ROLE
    ↓
Event Chair or Committee (Year 3+)
    ↓
Board Service (Year 4+)
```

Mentoring transforms a member's self-perception from **"participant"** to **"contributor"** with minimal risk.

### Why Mentor Is the Right First Step

| Challenge with Other Volunteer Roles | Why Mentor Avoids It |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Event Chair requires logistics skill | Mentor is just relationship |
| Committee work requires time commitment | Mentor is 1-2 hours over 90 days |
| Board service requires governance knowledge | Mentor has zero governance authority |
| Fear of "failing publicly" | Mentor relationship is private/low-stakes |

---

## Ownership

| Aspect | Owner |
|--------|-------|
| Mentor recruitment | VP Membership |
| Mentor-Newbie assignment | VP Membership |
| Mentor orientation/training | VP Membership |
| Mentor recognition | VP Membership (with President) |
| Escalation of issues | VP Activities (event-related) or President (all other) |

---

## Board Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is a Mentor? | A welcoming volunteer for new members' first 90 days |

| Do they have authority? | **No** — explicitly not a governance actor |
| Who owns this role? | VP Membership |
| Is it required for membership? | **No** — gateway to volunteering, not a membership qualifier |
| Why does it matter? | First step in the volunteer flywheel; reduces fear of volunteering |

## Appendix: Mentor Best Practices

### What to Tell Newbies

1. **You are not being evaluated.** There is no score.
2. **Questions are welcome.** Ask anything, any time.
3. **It gets easier.** The third event is much more comfortable than the first.
4. **You belong here.** Membership is not conditional on performance.

### What NOT to Say

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Check the website" | Answer the question directly |
| "You'll need to register first" | "Just sign up and you're in" |
| "Make sure you qualify" | "This is open to all members" |
