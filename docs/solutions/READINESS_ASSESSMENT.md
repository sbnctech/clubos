## Purpose

This assessment determines whether an organization is ready to begin a ClubOS implementation engagement. It identifies blockers, risks, and ownership gaps before work begins.

---

## What This Is / What This Is Not

| This Assessment IS | This Assessment IS NOT |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| A checklist for implementation readiness | A governance maturity audit |
| A blocker identification tool | A consulting discovery process |
| A go/no-go decision input | A sales qualification exercise |
| Focused on data, policy, and ownership | Focused on organizational strategy |

**Hard boundary:** This assessment covers technical and operational readiness only. Organizational change management, stakeholder alignment, and strategic planning are out of scope.

| **GREEN** | Ready to proceed | All hard requirements met; no red flags |
| **YELLOW** | Proceed with conditions | Minor gaps identified; remediation plan required |
