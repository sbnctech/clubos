## Purpose

This document defines what ClubOS engagements include and exclude.
It exists to protect both vendor and client from scope drift into
areas where we lack expertise, authority, or appropriate liability.

The boundary is simple: **We configure systems. We do not govern
organizations.**

---

## Core Boundary Statement

ClubOS will only translate rules required for safe system behavior.

We will NOT:
- Rewrite bylaws
- Reorganize boards
- Resolve leadership disputes
- Provide general management consulting
- Advise on organizational strategy

If governance change is required for safe system operation, we
provide a Decision Memo and stop until the client decides.

---

## What We Will Do

| Activity | In Scope |
|----------|----------|
| Translate existing membership rules into system config | Yes |
| Map current roles to ClubOS permission model | Yes |
| Identify policy gaps that affect system behavior | Yes |
| Document ambiguities for client decision | Yes |
| Configure system according to client decisions | Yes |
| Validate data against stated rules | Yes |
| Provide technical options for policy implementation | Yes |

---

## What We Will Not Do

| Activity | Out of Scope | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Draft or edit bylaws | Always | Legal document, requires attorney |
| Advise on board composition | Always | Governance, not technology |
| Recommend committee structure | Always | Organizational design |
| Mediate stakeholder disputes | Always | Conflict resolution expertise |
| Interpret legal requirements | Always | Requires licensed counsel |
| Advise on fundraising strategy | Always | Not our domain |
| Recommend event programming | Always | Not our domain |
| Provide HR or volunteer management advice | Always | Not our domain |
| Advise on insurance or liability | Always | Requires licensed broker |

---

## The Decision Memo Pattern

When we encounter a situation requiring governance decision:

1. **Stop work** on the affected area
2. **Document** the issue in a Decision Memo
3. **Present options** without recommendation (unless technical)
4. **Wait** for client decision in writing
5. **Resume** only after decision is documented

We do not proceed on assumption. We do not guess what the board
would decide. We do not pressure clients to decide faster.

## Escalation Path for Out-of-Scope Requests

When a client asks for something out of scope:

### Level 1: Clarify Intent
"I want to make sure I understand - are you asking us to [restate
request]? That would be outside our engagement scope because
[reason]. Would you like me to document what we can do instead?"

### Level 2: Offer Alternatives
"We can't [out-of-scope request], but we can:
- Document the issue for your board to decide
- Provide a Decision Memo with options
- Pause this area until you have internal clarity"

### Level 3: Formal Boundary
"This request is outside our scope as defined in our engagement
agreement. To proceed, we would need:
- A scope amendment with associated pricing
- Or, your decision to handle this internally before we continue"

### Level 4: Engagement Pause
"We've reached a point where we cannot proceed without decisions
that are outside our authority to make. We recommend pausing the
engagement until [specific blocker] is resolved. We will hold your
deliverables and resume when you're ready."

---

## Common Boundary Situations

### "Can you help us decide which membership levels to keep?"

**Response:** "We can show you how your current levels map to ClubOS
capabilities and what the technical tradeoffs are. The decision about
which levels your organization should offer is a governance question
for your board. Would you like a Decision Memo outlining the options?"

### "Our bylaws are outdated - can you help us rewrite them?"

**Response:** "Bylaws revision is outside our scope and typically
requires an attorney familiar with nonprofit governance. We can
document where your current bylaws create ambiguity for system
configuration, which might be useful input for that process."

### "Two board members disagree about how membership should work."

**Response:** "We need a single authoritative answer to configure
the system correctly. We can document both interpretations and the
system implications of each, but we cannot proceed until your board
reaches a decision. Would you like a Decision Memo?"

### "Can you recommend whether we should have committees or not?"

**Response:** "Organizational structure is a governance decision
outside our scope. We can configure ClubOS to support whatever
structure you decide on. If you'd like, we can show you how other
similar organizations have configured their systems."

### "What do other clubs do about [policy question]?"

**Response:** "We can share general patterns we've seen, but we
can't recommend what your organization should do. Every club has
different needs. If you'd like, we can document the options as a
Decision Memo for your board."

## Why These Boundaries Matter

### For the Client

- Decisions remain with authorized stakeholders
- No vendor dependency for governance
- Clear accountability for organizational choices
- Protected from vendor overreach

### For the Vendor

- Reduced liability exposure
- Clear scope for pricing and delivery
- Avoids expertise we don't have
- Protects team from impossible situations

### For the Engagement

- Faster delivery when scope is clear
- Fewer stalls from undefined authority
- Documented decisions prevent rework
- Clean handoff at engagement end

---

## Enforcement

All delivery team members are authorized to:
- Invoke these boundaries without manager approval
- Pause work when boundaries are threatened
- Request scope amendment before proceeding

No client pressure, timeline urgency, or commercial consideration
overrides these boundaries.

If a client insists on out-of-scope work:
- Document the request in writing
- Escalate to engagement owner
- Do not proceed until scope amendment is signed
