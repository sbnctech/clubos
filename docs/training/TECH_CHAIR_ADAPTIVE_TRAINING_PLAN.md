# Tech Chair Adaptive Training Plan

Worker 4 - Q-020 - Tech Chair Training - Report

## Purpose
Provide training that adapts to the Tech Chair profile:
- Track A: Volunteer Operator (low-code comfort, needs checklists)
- Track B: Engineering Steward (experienced engineer, skeptical of AI workflow)

## Principles
- Training is just-in-time (task + page + role + state).
- Prefer operational confidence over theory.
- Every module ends with a verification step.

## Track A: Volunteer Operator
Modules:
1. Daily health check (dashboard + alerts)
2. Common support requests (password, event signup, email delivery)
3. Safe changes workflow (branch, PR, review)
4. Incident playbook (what to do first, who to notify)

## Track B: Engineering Steward
Modules:
1. Maintainability case (why structure + tests + docs beat stagnation)
2. Architecture map (where to look, what not to touch)
3. Change control (guardrails, contracts, deny-path tests)
4. AI-assisted maintenance workflow (how to review, how to verify, how to rollback)

## Shared Artifacts
- Runbooks
- Checklists
- Glossary
- "If this, then that" troubleshooting trees

## Success Metrics
- Time-to-diagnose incidents
- Number of safe PRs merged without regressions
- Reduction in support ticket turnaround time
- Confidence survey after 30/90 days

## Verdict
READY FOR REVIEW
